## My Advent of Code puzzle solutions for 2018

These are kinda insanely commented for a programming contest/funtest.  I went overboard
because one of my daughters is also doing AOC in parallel and she and I compare 
solutions when we're done.  Likewise the long var names.  (Though, thanks to aggressive 
code-completion in Xcode, those aren't extra work.)

I run the smaller problems in Swift Playgrounds -- if a result is missing a corresponding print(), that's why.
